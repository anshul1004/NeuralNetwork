# NeuralNetwork

A 2-hidden layered Neural Nework is implemented from scratch, without using any external machine learning libraries. The neural network is trained on the Breast Cancer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/).

Before running the neural network, the data is pre-processed, which includes converting categorical to numerical attributes, handle null or missing values, standardization and normalization.

The neural network is trained using different activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh & ReLU. Training and testing error sum for different activation functions is calculated and compared to get the best activation function on the given dataset. 

Hyperparameters used: Learning rate, Max iterations, Train-test data percentage split
